# RubiksCube
We will create a class to represent Rubiks Cube and find different ways to easily brute force and solve it.

## The code is mainly divided into two parts: 
-> A rubik's cube class that represents a single permutation of a cube and ways to change it to a  
   different permutation. 
-> A file to define and modify permutations and create efficient ways to solve a rubik's cube.

## All stuff it does
-> We have tested if any random permutation given can be solvable or not, or are there only certain number of solvable permutations.


## TODO 
-> Create a random initializer and value provided initializer.
-> Add tests for vertical move and horizontal move.
-> Can add a clockwise / anti clockwise option for moves, investigate if it is worth it, and add the functionality if it is worth it.


## Followups 
-> Generalize this for cubes with more than 9 color tiles on each face.
