# RubiksCube
We will create a class to represent Rubiks Cube and find different ways to easily brute force and solve it.

## The code is mainly divided into two parts: 
-> A rubik's cube class that represents a single permutation of a cube and ways to change it to a  
   different permutation. 
-> A file to define and modify permutations and create efficient ways to solve a rubik's cube.



## TODO 
Complete horizontal move function. 
Add tests for vertical move and horizontal move.


## Followups 
-> Generalize this for cubes with more than 9 color tiles on each face.
