# RubiksCube
We will create a class to represent Rubiks Cube and find different ways to easily brute force and solve it.

## The code is divided into the following parts: 
* The face class, which represents a single face on a cube.  
    * Face class can get ith row and ith column.
    * It also supports being able to swap ith row and ith column to a specified row/column.
* Cube class, which stores 6 faces.
    * Cube class can make a horizontal move, of a strip, or vertical move.
* Testing has been integrated using catch framework.

## TODO 
* Add tests for vertical move, horizontal move, and Cube initialization. 
* Write down the basic brute force algorithm to solve the cube. Find some other efficient algorithms, and see if you can make it better?   
* Maybe find a way to make a 3D representation of it? 

## Followups 
* Generalize this for cubes with more than 9 color tiles on each face.
