# RubiksCube
We will create a class to represent Rubiks Cube and find different ways to easily brute force and solve it.

## The code is mainly divided into the following parts: 
-> The face class, which represents a single face on a cube.
  ->
## All stuff it does
-> We have tested if any random permutation given can be solvable or not, or are there only certain number of solvable permutations.   


## TODO 
-> (tgandhi) Add tests for vertical move and horizontal move.   
   -> Integrate catch 2   
   -> Update the dir. structure to separate includes, binary code (in /bin) and tests.     
-> (tdgandhi) Can add a clockwise / anti clockwise option for moves, investigate if it is worth it, and add the functionality if it is worth it.    
-> Validate the creation of cube and face. (make sure no unexpected errors happen) (especially with this default constructor business)      
-> Write down the basic brute force algorithm. Find some other efficient algorithms, and see if you can make it better?
-> Maybe find a way to make a 3D representation of it?

## Followups 
-> Generalize this for cubes with more than 9 color tiles on each face.
